Let's take a look at some of the oldest players ever drafted into the NFL.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Jan Stenerud, K, Green Bay Packers | 29 years, 7 months</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jan Stenerud, a Norwegian-born kicker, made history as one of the oldest players ever drafted into the NFL. Selected by the Green Bay Packers in the 3rd round of the 1966 AFL Draft, Stenerud was 29 years and 7 months old at the time, making him one of the more mature rookies to enter the league. Stenerud had a successful career in the NFL, becoming the first pure placekicker to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Ola Kimrin, K, Washington Redskins | 30 years, 10 months</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Ola Kimrin, another kicker, was drafted by the Washington Redskins in 2003 at the age of 30 years and 10 months. Hailing from Sweden, Kimrin had a brief stint with the Redskins and the Dallas Cowboys, showcasing the potential for players from non-traditional football backgrounds to make their mark in the league.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Tom Landry, P, New York Giants | 30 years, 11 months</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Tom Landry, not to be confused with the legendary coach of the same name, was drafted as a punter by the New York Giants in 1947 at the age of 30 years and 11 months. Landry's selection at such an advanced age was a testament to his skills as a punter, and he went on to have a respectable career in the NFL.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Tony Sands, RB, Kansas City Chiefs | 30 years, 11 months</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Tony Sands, a running back, was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in 1992 at the age of 30 years and 11 months. Sands, an older prospect at the time of his draft, had a short-lived NFL career but his selection at an advanced age remains a noteworthy part of NFL draft history.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Chris Weinke, QB, Carolina Panthers | 28 years, 8 months</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Chris Weinke took a unique path to the NFL, starting his football career late after pursuing baseball initially. After a successful college football career at Florida State University, Weinke was drafted by the Carolina Panthers in 2001 at the age of 28 years and 8 months. Despite being one of the oldest players to be drafted as a quarterback, Weinke's NFL career didn't reach the heights of his college success, but he did make his mark as a unique entry in the NFL draft history.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Brandon Weeden, QB, Cleveland Browns | 28 years old</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Brandon Weeden was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the 2012 NFL Draft at the age of 28, making him the oldest player ever taken in the first round at that time. Weeden, who had pursued a baseball career before transitioning to football, had a somewhat tumultuous career in the NFL, serving as a starter and later as a backup for several teams, including the Dallas Cowboys, Houston Texans, and Tennessee Titans.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The NFL has seen its fair share of older rookies being drafted into the league, with players from various positions making their mark despite entering the league at an advanced age. These players have added an interesting dimension to the history of the NFL draft, showcasing that age is indeed just a number when it comes to pursuing professional football careers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn6hlp5bAbsDHnmSopJSawLV5z6WYsp2iYrK3sdFmm6uZlqmypXnTqGStoJViu6e4</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tahiry-jose-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Tahiry Jose Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
