Bringing his 30+ years of an experience as an auctioneer and valuer, Nick helped the contestants auction the antiques at their best price.</span></p><p><span>This article is Nick’s Wikipedia discussing his wife, age, and more.</span></p><h3><b>Nick Hall On Bargain Hunt</b></h3><p><span>Nick Hall has been a part of </span><i><span>Bargain Hunt</span></i><span> for more than 14 years.</span></p><p><span>But initially, he stepped into the BBC world as an antique expert with </span><i><span>Flog it</span></i><span>. One fateful day, he was then asked to do a screen test as an expert, and some years later while he was recording the auctioneers’ chat with </span><i><span>Bargain Hunt</span></i><span>, they asked if he would like to become one of their experts too.</span></p><p><span>His favorite part about being on the BBC show was the excitement and drama of Sale Day. Being on the rostrum wielding a gavel, with bids coming in thick and fast from the crowded saleroom, from the myriad of phone bids, and the internet flashing in from around the world, it gave him a rush of adrenaline.</span></p><p><span>So far, his most memorable co-star on the show is Maeve the Rave. I think Maeve at Stamford stands out, a lady of advancing years with the tenacity and spirit of someone half her age, and the cheek of a teenager too,” he explained.</span></p><p><span>Overall, he just is proud to be a part of </span><i><span>Bargain Hunt</span></i><span>. He believes that the show is successful because of the fascinating and charming characters, and the challenges combined with the great knowledge.</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span>On </span><i><span>Bargain Hunt</span></i><span>, Nick’s most profit was £500 on a pair of Japanese vases (see above). And his Greatest loss might have been on a very rustic and gruesome Pig Bench (for slaughtering pigs on!) sold for less than £100.</span></p><h3><b>Nick Hall Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>Nick Hall flaunted a net worth of $1 million in 2022.</span></p><p><span>An auctioneer, valuer, antique expert, and TV personality, Nick started his career in antiques back in his late teens. At the time, he quit </span><i><span>Sixth Form College </span></i><span>in Sussex and decided to rather get out into the real world, get his hands dirty and find “something interesting” to earn a living.</span></p><p><span>With no set career path in mind, Nick then explore several local businesses that “looked interesting” to see if they had any openings, including a Theatre, Radio Station, and amongst other things the local Auctioneers.</span></p><p><span>Now, Nick’s an Auctioneer and Valuer at </span><i><span>Bentley’s Fine Art Auctioneers Ltd</span></i><span>. Their auction house held a 1000-lot auction on the first Saturday of every month. And it sold items including an eclectic array of Antiques, 20th Century Design, Collectors’ items, Fine Art & Modern Art, unusual Interior pieces, and decorative Furnishings.</span></p><p><span>For those interested to buy, the company held regular monthly sales throughout the year. And for those looking to sell, you can bring your items for appraisal to them at </span><i><span>The Old Granary</span></i><span> freon Monday to Friday 9.30 am – 5 pm.</span></p><p><span>The main benefit of working with them is that they provided valuations for goods for sale at auction free of charge. Also, they offered an in-house local collection and delivery service for goods consigned for sale or for larger items that have been purchased at Auction.</span></p><p><span>Find </span><i><span>Bentley’s Auctioneers</span></i><span> on FB @</span><a href=#><span>bentleysfineartauctioneers</span></a><span> and Twitter @</span><a href=#><span>BentleysKent</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>For those interested work in antiques, Nick emplores them to get their foot in the door of an auction house as soon as they can. Whatever the role, just get inside, then watch and learn.</span></p><p><span>If Nick wasn’t an auctioneer, he would have enjoyed the life of an actor. “The theatre and drama of an auction have a similar buzz and rush of adrenalin,” he explained.</span></p><h3><b>Is Nick Hall On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span>Sadly, we couldn’t find Nick on Instagram.</span></p><p><span>However, here are his Facebook accounts @</span><a href=#><span>nick.hall.395891</span></a><span> and @</span><a href=#><span>Nick Hall</span></a><span>, and his Twitter @</span><a href=#><span>nickhallfineart</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Nick Hall Age</b></h3><p><span>Nick Hall was 53 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span>He was one of the older experts on </span><i><span>Bargain Hunt</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Nick Hall Wife</b></h3><p><span>Nick Hall was married to Debbie Marshall (now ex-wife).</span></p><p><span>His former wife, Debbie hails from Broughty Ferry, Dundee City, United Kingdom, and is an active philanthropist.
