Im very touchy about cars. I dont want anybody leaning on them or closing the door too hard, know what I mean?&nbsp;<strong>– Scott Baio</strong></p><p>I dont have an iPod. I dont get the whole iPod thing. Who has time to listen to that much music? If I had one, it would probably have Sinatra, Beatles, some 70s music, some 80s music, and thats it.&nbsp;<strong>– Scott Baio</strong></p><p>One thing I wont be doing on a weekend is shopping.
