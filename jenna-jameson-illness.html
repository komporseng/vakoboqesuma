A<span>&nbsp;film star who spent over a year in the hospital due to a health concern is providing fans with an update on her recuperation.</span></p><h2><strong>What Did Jenna Jameson Say About Her Illness?</strong></h2><p>Jameson spoke forward about the unidentified ailment that left her with extreme muscle weakness which physicians suspected may have been numerous other illnesses/diseases such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and blood malignancy.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Jenna Jameson, 49, opened up about her mystery illness that left her with “extreme muscle weakness,” which doctors speculated may have been “numerous other illnesses/diseases” including Guillain-Barré syndrome and blood cancer.</p><p>— TheTexasOne (@TexasRepublic71) <a href=# rel=noopener>August 31, 2023</a></p><p>However, the test results were negative. When her problems first appeared Jameson said:</p><p>“It started very suddenly, I was doing very well and then I just started collapsing and lost my ability to walk … they admitted me into the hospital. I think I spent about nine months in the hospital.”</p><p>Jameson was also informed by the physicians that she had six months in a year to live. She confessed:</p><p>“When I was first told that I didn’t have very long to live, I think I just balled up, I didn’t really know how to digest that.”</p><p>After being in the hospital for months without receiving a definitive diagnosis or any relief from her problems, Jameson made the decision to leave. She told:</p><p>“I finally got to the point where I was like, I have to take my health into my own hands, so I put myself in a wheelchair and I wheeled myself out of the hospital. I ended up just taking everything into my own hands and making it happen. I knew that I still had so much life left to live.”</p><p>Jameson was resolved to follow a more holistic path after leaving the hospital, so she made significant changes to her life, including continuing to eat healthily. Jameson said:</p><p>“I was having a lot of memory issues and I lost years and years and years of my life, so I started going to a cognitive therapist that puts you through puzzles and all these things, and everything just started reconnecting. I feel myself coming back to life when I eat correctly, keto wise. I feel energetic.”</p><p>Despite the fact that Jameson’s holistic approach has greatly helped, according to her rep, she isn’t 100% better but feels more positive about her future now.</p><p>In May, Jameson wed podcast host Jessi Lawless. Jameson spent his first nearly two months in the hospital in early 2022. Even with a walker, Jameson was unable to walk during her unidentified sickness.</p><p><strong>If you want to get more information related to the health of other stars you can read our below posts:</strong></p><p>You can <a href=# rel=noopener>follow us on Twitter</a> and read our most recent posts to know more about illnesses affecting other celebrities, health updates, and other topics.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdhZXxzfo6jnKemkWK3ornErKanZZmhua%2Bx0qxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-statham-hunts-down-post-malone-in-wrath-of-man-trailer-watch.html><span>←</span><span>Jason Statham Hunts Down Post Malone in 'Wrath of Man' Trailer - Watch!</span></a>
