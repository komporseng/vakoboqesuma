He donated 100 percent of the $18 million that the event raised to Operation Underground Railroad, a nonprofit organization that aims to eradicate child sex trafficking.</p><p>“Tony believes that the secret to living is giving,” the motivational speaker’s wife, <strong>Sage Robbins</strong>, said in a statement in 2020. “He has devoted his life to helping people realize their passions and change their circumstances. I cannot think of a better way to celebrate this milestone birthday than to support his mission and commitment to O.U.R., with the goal of saving thousands more children from some of the worst conditions on Earth.”</p><p>Tony’s party (which took place during a leap year) included performances by <strong>Pitbull</strong>, <strong>Melissa Etheridge</strong>, <strong>Andy Grammer</strong>, <strong>Leona Lewis</strong> and Cold War Kids. The star-studded guest list included <strong>Paris Hilton</strong>, <strong>Julianne Hough</strong>, <strong>Derek Hough</strong>, <strong>Gerard Butler</strong> and<strong> Annette Bening</strong>.</p><p>Scroll down to see stars who were born on February 29!</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Usmagazine.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6topJWWvW7FxJqpZpqRl7amv4ycnKWdkqe2tbXErGSwoJ9ixKa%2BxGaZqKqeYryvecWemautkafGbn6YaHaapaA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-deere-4052m-compact-utility-tractor-specs.html><span>←</span><span>John Deere 4052M Compact Utility Tractor Price, Specs &amp;amp; Features 2022</span></a>
