Drag Queen Jax On RuPaul’s Drag Race Season 15 It’s time for another season of RuPaul’s Drag Race, but this time the stakes are higher.

High stakes, mean more drama, and more drama means Jax isn’t going to have an easy time.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But then again, Jax isn’t here to make friends. She is in it to win it. Furthermore, it was </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>RuPaul’s Drag Race</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> that first introduced the art of drag to her. So, she’s here to prove herself and how far she’s come. “I started watching Drag Race the week my grandmother passed away. It just sparked something in me creatively,” she said.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Super excited to share her journey, Jax took to her IG to write, “Make room for the JAX-flips. Get in b*tches, we’re going to #DragRace Season 15 premieres FRIDAY JAN 6 at 8/7c on @mtv !”</span></p><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>RuPaul’s Drag Race</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> season 15 is set to hit the screen on January 6, 2023, with the biggest grand prize in franchise history i.e. of&nbsp; $200 thousand. But that’s not the only change hitting the competition this season.

She would make straight men go crazy over her any day. Just look at her!</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Drag-Queen-Jax-Out-Of-Drag-300x268.jpg><h3><b>How Old Is Drag Queen Jax?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jax was 25 years of age when she appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>RuPaul’s Drag Race</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2023.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She was one of the younger contestants that season.</span></p><h3><b>Drag Queen Jax Real Name</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Drag Queen Jax’s real name is Jackson McGoldrick.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her stage name comes from the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Mortal Kombat</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (video game) character “Jax Brigg.”</span></p><h3><b>Drag Queen Jax Job</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Drag Queen Jax is a full-time queen and a part-time photographer. Infact, she has a BFA in photography and videography from the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>School of Visual Arts</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. Find her photography works on FB @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>jacksonmcgphoto</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> and her website “jacksonmcgoldrick.com.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Back in November 2013, she even participated in an exhibit at the</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> Gratia Gillespie Art Gallery</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> at Atria Darien, 50 Ledge Road.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now coming to her time as a drag queen, Jax first began drag as a way to create a satirical commentary of her upbringing in suburban Connecticut. She used to formulate photographs around conversations she overheard in her town and create amplified personifications to place in front of the camera.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The first time she ever performed as “Jax” was at an open stage set for a local Queen’s final show at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Icon</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in New York City. That night, she performed “My way” a song by Noah Cyrus, and the feedback was phenomenal! “The People refused to believe it was my first time performing in drag, my background as a cheerleader simply went into overdrive the second the music started,” she recalled.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, her aesthetic has evolved over the years. “I quickly learned that drag in its nature is already so political, and that I don’t have to hit people over the head with it,” she explained. Now, she stylizes her drag around the things she loves and who “Jackson” is — an athlete, of mixed-race from the Caribbean, a suburbs child — “I found a way to mash this all together and that is who/what JAX is,” she added.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For Jax, the art of drag is just like any other sport. Infact, her competitive athlete background has instilled in her a work ethic she wishes to bring to her Drag.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, what sets Jax apart from others? Well, it’s her originality. Jax’s mic work is 100% improvised. She doesn’t like to perform scripted shows.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Overall, drag has helped Jax learn to celebrate the things she used to think could be her detriment growing up. So, she wants to keep inspiring others to share their stories as well and be themselves every chance they get, “You never know who can relate and who needs to hear it. By sharing you can help someone feel less alone,” she added.</span></p><h3><b>Is Drag Queen Jax On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Find her on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>getjaxed</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, here’s her Facebook @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>jackson.mcgoldrick</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, TikTok @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>getjaxed</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, and Twitter @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>thatbitchjax</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Drag Queen Jax Partner</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Drag Queen Jax’s partner is a charming man named Patrick Jankowski. The two were together at least since 2020.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to the star, Patrick was her best friend, her caffeine addiction, and her literal rock. She never understood the term partner until meeting him. However, every day her understanding of the term grows more and more as she can’t imagine going through life without him by her side.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Likewise, Patrick feels blessed to have her. She is his “inspiration, motivation, wrestling opponent, and [his] only.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jax’s partner, Patrick is a&nbsp; Cape Canaveral native who attended </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Yale University</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.
