There’s the 5000-page-long menu, huge drinks, free bread, and giant crowds. The last people that you’d expect in a Sunday afternoon Cheesecake Factory crowd are Kimye. And yet, these <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Kim Kardashian and Kanye West Cheesecake Factory photos</a> beg to differ. It looks like, actually, the Kardashian-Wests love that place.</p><p>Kim and Kanye went to the Cheesecake Factory not once but twice&nbsp;last weekend. They were in Dayton, Ohio for Kanye’s Sunday Services, and they took their <a href=# rel=noopener>oldest kids North and Saint</a> to dine at the restaurant on Friday and Saturday night. The internet now abounds with hilarious and fascinating photos of <a href=# rel=noopener>the famous couple</a> looking completely out of their element in that instantly-recognizable Cheesecake Factory setting — menus, huge drinks, glass partitions and all.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-kanye-west.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/kim-kardashian-odell-beckham-jr.png><p>There is prior evidence that Kim and Kanye enjoy the same low-brow meals as the rest of us. Way back in the dinosaur age of 2013, the couple hung out at a Wendy’s in Philly for a post-concert meal. You can’t blame them! But what does a Kardashian-West even pick from the 5000-page menu at the Cheesecake Factory? Pasta? Flatbread? Something from that mysterious “Skinnylicious” section? Seriously, the people need to know.</p><p>People reports that, “among other dishes,” they <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">shared the Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake</a>. They apparently chose to ignore the other 34 cheesecake options. (Yes, I just counted.) Also, what “other dishes”?! We may never know for sure.</p><p>Ohio residents obviously swarmed the restaurant after news of the Kardashian-West’s visit spread on the internet. One person’s mom tried and failed to take a sneaky photo of Kanye.</p><p>Another person captured this photo of ‘Ye attempting to hold a phone conversation just beyond the glass partition. This image deserves a prize!</p><p>BRB, gotta go wait in line for an hour to eat the same cheesecake as Kim and ‘Ye.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9j21nbHFkZLiquYykmKuckai1qq3NZqKapqmaerix0q1knKCVmsCmr8CknGaekZjBsL7YZqehp6SkwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ian-dunlap-obituary.html><span>←</span><span>Ian Dunlap Obituary: The pain was excruciating as he breathed his last breath in his wifes arms</span></a>
