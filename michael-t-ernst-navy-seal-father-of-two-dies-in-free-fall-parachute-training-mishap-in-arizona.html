Ernst, a native of <a href=# rel>Massachusetts</a>, enlisted in the Navy in August 2009 and, following completion of special-operations training, joined his first operational naval special warfare unit in 2012, according to Navy Personnel Command.</p><h2 class=split>A celebrated officer</h2><p>The military man quickly advanced through the ranks and was awarded the Silver Star, the third-highest combat decoration in the service. Besides this, in his 14 years career span, he has been decorated on numerous occasions with various awards including a Joint commendation medal, Army Achievement Medal, and several others. He was also awarded the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the NATO Medal besides three Sea Service Deployment Ribbons.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>'He will never be forgotten'</h2><p>“Mike was an exceptional teammate. He was a dedicated NSW Sailor who applied his talents and skills toward some of our nation’s hardest challenges, while selflessly mentoring his teammates. Mike and his family will always be part of the NSW family, and he will never be forgotten,” said Rear Adm. Keith Davids, who heads Naval Special Warfare Command. He further added, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Ernst family."</p><p>The Navy SEAL Foundation is saddened by the loss of a <a href=# rel=nofollow>"warrior and teammate"</a>. "As you can imagine, Mike's wife, two children (ages five and almost three), and the NSW community are devastated by this loss. The NSF team has been working with the Command to support everyone's needs.", it wrote in a fundraising post.</p><h2 class=split>Free fall incidents over the years&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>In June 2014, Chief Special Warfare Operator Bradley S Cavner, 31, of Coronado died in a parachute training accident in El Centro. In March 2013, Chief Special Warfare Operator Brett Shadle 31, of Elizabethville was killed when he collided with another SEAL parachutist during a military free-fall training jump in Marana. Also, while it wasn’t part of military training, a veteran SEAL combat officer, Cmdr Seth A Stone, 41, died in September 2017 after parachuting from a hot-air balloon during a recreational jump in Perris.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopZmYtaKxy2arZp2io8C1ec2arbJlo5qurXnFmquhnaJivKd507CmZpyZmsButc1mnaudlWKzorjLZqeaqpGYtbbAxGarq5mZo7avs4ymoKygkaV6qrqMmqmisp%2Bjrg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-are-kwame-appiah-siblings-barbara-and-jerry.html><span>←</span><span>Barbara Tennor And Jerry Appiah</span></a>
