TMZ reported that the pair have been separated since January and tried to reconcile but “failed.” <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six </a>claimed that Dalton flew to London in January to visit Ariana while she was working on Wicked <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>and was unable to save their marriage</a>.&nbsp;TMZ further reported that Dalton has been <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“dating over the last few months”</a> following his split from Ariana. The “Thank U, Next” singer is reportedly “fine” with her ex moving on in the dating world, per TMZ.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Ariana started the split speculation when she attended Wimbledon&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>without her wedding ring</a>&nbsp;on July 16. She sat next to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Andrew Garfield</strong></a>&nbsp;and her&nbsp;Wicked&nbsp;co-star&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jonathan Bailey</strong></a> for the tennis event, with her husband nowhere to be found. The following day, the news broke that Ariana and Dalton had split up in January. Despite the end of their marriage, the pop star and the real estate broker have reportedly stayed “really good friends” throughout the separation.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Ariana and Dalton started dating in early 2020, but the relationship wasn’t confirmed until Dalton appeared in his girlfriend’s <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Stuck with U”</a> music video that came out in May 2020, while the couple was<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> quarantining together</a>. Ariana <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>confirmed she was engaged</a> to Dalton in December 2020 with a photo of her engagement ring. Five months later, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the couple got married</a> in a private and intimate wedding ceremony that only 20 people attended. After tying the knot, Ariana and Dalton kept their romance out of the spotlight, save for <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>some rare public outings</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FpZpqqmZa7onnGq5innJVisaLAyKeeZq%2BZmLimsIycpqyskad6psDHmqVmq5yWwaa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./raymond-craig-turner-cause-of-death-what-happened-to-tina-turners-son.html><span>←</span><span>What happened to Tina Turner's son?</span></a>
