Young Louis had an older brother, but when he died just before the outbreak of the French Revolution, Louis became the heir to the French throne. And when King Louis XVI was executed during the revolution in 1793, eight-year-old Louis became the new king — at least to those who supported the royals. He was imprisoned upon his ascension to the throne and died in captivity at the age of 10.</p><h2>1899: Guglielmo Marconi Sends The First International Radio Transmission</h2><p>Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi successfully sends the first international radio transmission across the English Channel, from northern France to Kent, England. The message was broadcast to The Times newspaper and said:</p><p>“Communication between England and the Continent was set up yesterday morning by the Marconi system of wireless telegraphy… Signor Marconi is here conducting the trials and is very satisfied with the results.”</p><h2>1977: The Tenerife Airport Disaster</h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-414161 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/tenerife-airport-disaster-wreckage.jpg alt="Tenerife Airport Disaster" width=900 height=676 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-414161 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The wreckage of KLM Flight 4805, one of the airplanes involved in the collision.</span></p><p>Two Boeing 747 jets collide on the runway of Tenerife, Spain’s Los Rodeos Airport, killing 583 passengers and crew members. On the day of the crash, the runway was congested due to a bombing at another nearby airport while thick fog in the area made for low visibility.</p><p>The captain of KLM Flight 4805 was attempting to take off when he collided with Pan Am Flight 1736, which was taxiing on the runway. All 248 people aboard KLM 4805 and 335 people on Pan Am 1736 died, though 61 passengers and crew members in the front section of the Pan Am flight survived. The accident was the deadliest in aviation history.</p><h2>1984: Bobby Joe Long Murders His First Victim</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-414162 alt="Bobby Joe Long" width=800 height=794 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bobby-joe-long.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-414162 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>Bobby Joe Long, the “Classified Ad Rapist.”</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Bobby Joe Long</a>, also known as the “Classified Ad Rapist,” murders his first known victim, Artiss “Ann” Wick. The 20-year-old woman was reportedly hitchhiking from Indiana to Florida when Long picked her up in the Tampa Bay Area, raped her, and strangled her to death. Her body was found in a rural area eight months later, around the same time Long was arrested for the kidnapping of <a href=# rel=noopener>Lisa McVey</a>. He eventually pleaded guilty to eight homicides and was later sentenced to death.</p><h2>1995: Maurizio Gucci Is Murdered</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-351323 alt="Roberto Gucci With Georgio Gucci And Maurizio Gucci" width=900 height=581 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/roberto-gucci-with-georgio-gucci-and-maurizio-gucci.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-351323 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Laurent MAOUS/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Roberto Gucci, Georgio Gucci, and Maurizio Gucci attend a store opening in Paris, France, on September 22, 1983.</span></p><p>Italian businessman <a href=# rel=noopener>Maurizio Gucci</a>, who was once the head of the Gucci fashion house, is fatally shot by a hitman while leaving his office in Milan, Italy. His ex-wife, <a href=# rel=noopener>Patrizia Reggiani</a>, had hired the killer because of jealousy and resentment toward Gucci, according to prosecutors.
