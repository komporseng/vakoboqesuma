However, at the time of writing this article, the only IG post where Brogan featured her fiance was dated Dec 31, 2021, captioned, “ B Y E . 2 0 2 1.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This sewing expert and her fiance bought their first home in Leicestershire in April 2022, and they shared it with their sausage dog named Roger.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Brogan loved making clothes for Roger. They even often flaunted matching outfits.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Talking a little about Matt, he is a Shepshed, England native who loves snowboarding and playing soccer. Also, he’s an admirer of arts and architecture.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Here’s her FB @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>matthewallardd</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Brogan Sommerville Height</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Brogan Sommerville stands tall at a height above 5 feet 6 inches (167 cm).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mentioning her distinct features, she has big brown eyes, dark hair, and an oblong face.</span></p><h3><b>Brogan Sommerville Job</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Brogan Sommerville might be a Spanish and French secondary school teacher, but her main practice would undoubtedly be sewing.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Creative from a young age, Brogan always loved to be involved in some kind of craft.

Thereafter, Brogan then started watching sewing tutorials online and made her first garment — a tweed cape complete with sparkly love heart buttons, which she wore for school.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Sewing Bee</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> contestant, her passion for sewing came naturally. She didn’t have anyone to each her. It was only through trial and error that she flaunts her skills today.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As a sewer who defined her style to be “very girly and feminine,” she enjoys replicating high street clothes for herself which are chic and ultra-feminine. Even on a supermarket run, she’s the kind of person to make a fashion statement by wearing a handmade puff sleeve creation</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Brogan admitted that she was “a bit of a selfish sewer.” She mainly sew for herself and didn’t spare much time for other work outside of her job as a teacher. But then again one of the reasons Brogan started sewing was because it allowed her to portray her own personal style through everything she wore.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her inspirations are vintage or retro silhouettes</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>When Brogan isn’t sewing, she loved writing blogs over “thecrafypie.com.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For those of you wondering, a language teacher (Brogan’s job) in the UK made around $44 thousand per annum.</span></p><h3><b>Is Brogan Sommerville On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, find her on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>the_crafty_pie</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, here’s her TikTok @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>the_crafty_pie</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, and Facebook @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>brogan.sommerville</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Where Is Brogan Sommerville From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Brogan hails from Edinburgh.
