Her Bio, Age, Parents, Dating</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> ever since its first release in July 2016 has grabbed hold of its audience with its best possible storyline and the young lead cast who are as talented as they are adorable. </span><span>And so far the series’ recent fourth season (premiered on 27 May 2022), Netflix had introduced to us many amazing actors. Shawnee Pourier whom we are going to discuss in the rest of the writing stars in the new season in a guest role and despite this, she has managed to leave the internet obsessed with her cuteness.</span></p><p><span>The rest — read through this ‘Shawnee Pourier BIO’.</span></p><h3><b>Shawnee Pourier On </b><b><i>Stranger Things</i></b></h3><p><span>Shawnee Pourier, since being seen on </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>has gone viral on TikTok and Twitter.</span></p><p><span>Her character appears in S04 E01 titled “Chapter One: The Hellfire Club” where she interacts with Will Byers (actor Noah Schnapp). Shawnee’s cute high school girl shows interest in Will and tries to flirt with him for a brief moment during Eleven’s (actress Millie Bobby Brown) presentation in front of the class. But, Will does not seem interested and she feels rejected.</span></p><p><span>As of 2022, IMDB had listed Shawnee’s role as the ‘cute girl’. Given her escalating popularity, the makers might just consider upgrading her role to one with more screen time.</span></p><h3><b>Shawnee Pourier Career</b></h3><p><span>&nbsp;Other than Stranger Things Shawnee Pourier is known for her roles in Dark Winds (2022) and Seeds (2022).</span></p><p>In the psychological thriller, Dark Winds&nbsp;Shawnee plays a 19-year-old Anna Attcity. The show is backed by some celebrated names and author George R.R. Martin of Game of Thrones, and actor Robert Redford are listed among its executive producers. It was scheduled to premiere simultaneously on AMC and AMC+ on 12 June 2022. As for its storyline, it is set in 1971 when a tribal police chief Joe Leaphorn (actor Zahn McClarnon) is dealing with two sudden tragedies, the violent murder of a senior citizen Hosteen Tso (actor Harrison Lowe), and the inexplicable death of Shawnee’s Anna.</p><p>The year 2022 seems to be the year Shawnee made her debut in to acting. The only remaining acting credit of her that we missed to tell is of the ‘rude girl’ in the short film/video&nbsp;Raven&nbsp;(2022).</p><p>As of the time of this writing, she was repped by the agency, The O’ Agency.</p><h3><b>How Much Is Shawnee Pourier Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Shawnee Pourier reportedly had less than $75K as her net worth as of 2022. </span><span>But, considering she is still only a teenager, this is still already a triumph for her.</span></p><p>Shawnee likely was still in grade 10 (as of June 2022) as the 11 of August 2021 was her first day of school in this class. Proud of her “duckling” Shawnee’s sister Samantha had taken to share about it on her IG. Also so you know, at the time Shawnee went to Cibola High School.</p><h3><b>Shawnee Pourier Age</b></h3><p><span>Shawnee Pourier was born in 2005.

Pourier, Emonee Rose Pourier, Samantha Jo Pourier, and Shawnee. Also, at the time, she was no longer together with Shawnee’s father, Sean Pourier.</span></p><p><span>Sean, according to his Facebook, worked at 3 Feathers Star Quilts (likely his own business) and lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico as of 2022; and went to Red Cloud Indian School in the past.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/shawnee-pourier-bio-age-parents-dating-stranger-things-2022-1-300x226.jpg><p><span>We saw Shawnee’s sister Samantha joke that they might be getting a stepmom, in an Instagram post from August 2021. Sister Samantha could be found on Instagram @sammiejj_3feathersboss. She seemed like the eldest sibling and on her birthday on 21 May 2021, Shawnee loving wrote a long birthday message for her and called her sister, momager, and the best line reader there is. Shawnee thanked her for staying up late with her because she could not remember that one line; and for letting her rant to her about literal nonsense.</span></p><p><span>The other sisters: Emonee Pourier was on Instagram @emoneepourier and Chaylee was the one who went to Red Cloud Indian School.</span></p><p>Shawnee and her family also appear to have survived the loss of her brother Alvin Iron Cloud III, and one adorable sister. Of them, the sister seemed to have died more recently.</p><p><span>And Shawnee, who is horrible when it comes to goodbyes, also has a 3-year-old nephew. She says she feels really lucky to be this smart little dude’s auntie. “You’ve only been on this planet for two years and it feels like I’ve known you forever. I am so excited to see what kind of person you become. I love you siča”, she wrote on Instagram to wish him on his birthday when he turned 2 in April 2021.</span></p><h3><b>Is Shawnee Pourier Dating Anyone?</b></h3><p><span>Shawnee Pourier did not seem to be dating anyone publicly.</span></p><h3><b>Shawnee Pourier Height</b></h3><p><span>Slim-built Shawnee Pourier stood 5′ 6″ in height and weighed around 110.00 lbs as of June 2022.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h3><b>When Is Shawnee Pourier Birthday?</b></h3></li></ul><p><span>Shawnee celebrates her birthday on the 26th of January, thus making her an Aquarius.</span></p><ul><li><h3><b>Where Is Shawnee Pourier From?</b></h3></li></ul><p><span>Shawnee hails from Thunder Valley in South Dakota.
