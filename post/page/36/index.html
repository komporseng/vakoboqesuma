I don't see the point of giving Normal type attack moves to any other type but Normal. I think all normal type moves are bad without the STAB a Normal pokemon would get from them. The reason I say this is because a Normal type move will never be super effective discounting Hidden Power and Judgement because these moves become other elemental types.So really if you gave lets say a Hydreigon with a very high special attack a Hyper Beam, this move won't get STAB and will never be super effective against any opponent and therefore is only reliable for it's base power.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who Is Kerri Higuchi, John Cho Wife?
