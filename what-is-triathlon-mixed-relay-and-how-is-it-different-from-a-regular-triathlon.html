Archery, Judo, the mixed 4x400m relay in track, and the mixed 4x100m medley relay in swimming all consist of mixed relay events.</p><h2>What’s the difference between the regular triathlon and mixed relay?</h2><p>Every athlete who competes in the mixed team relay at the Olympics must also have competed in the individual triathlon event.</p><p>The reason for implementing a triathlon mixed relay is for it’s part beyond helping bring equality to the&nbsp;most gender-balanced games&nbsp;in history, the triathlon mixed relay will promote unity between male and female athletes.</p><p>The mixed relay is also significantly shorted than the individual event, which involves a 1.5km swim, a 40km cycle, and a 10km run.</p><p>The individual triathlon pits 55 of the world’s best men and women over a gruelling 51.5km course.</p><p>Athletes will begin the race with a 1km swim loop along the shoreline before exiting the water briefly. They will then complete a further 500m loop before entering the first transition area which is situated on the shoreline.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-text-align-center>? <strong>TOKYO OLYMPICS LIVE: <a href=#>All the latest from the Games with our live blog</a></strong></p><p class=has-text-align-center>? <strong>WHAT’S ON TODAY? <a href=#>Best bits to watch at the Olympics and UK times for your favourite stars</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000265881132.jpg><p>Triathletes will then mount their bikes at the start of on an eight-lap, 5km loop before returning to the transition area on the shore of Tokyo Bay before embarking on a 2.5km, four-lap final sprint run.</p><p>As a guide you can expect the men’s race to take approximately 1:45 – 1:50, with the women’s race around 10 minutes longer – so compare that to the mixed team relay – it’s much longer.</p><h2>When is the triathlon mixed relay?</h2><p>The mixed team relay will be held <strong>on Saturday July 31.</strong></p><p>For anyone watching in Britain, it will be a late night, with coverage of the event starting at <strong>11:30pm BST</strong> on July 30 and running overnight.</p><p>You can follow all the action on our <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SunSport live blog.</a></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnp52utXnIrGStqpmWwam4zqdkpqGomrFuvsSlmLJlkaOxbrTOsGSiq12ewW6wyJ%2BdnqqVo8FustGopGaZXaeyqMHLmqlmrKKerrW0y6ilaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./roger-pollard-obituary-and-death-cause.html><span>←</span><span>Roger Pollard | Obituary And Death Cause</span></a>
