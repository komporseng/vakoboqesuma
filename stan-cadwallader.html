Annie Ruth and Freddie were his two older sisters. He grew up in his hometown and attended the University of Alabama following high school, where he began honing his humorous skills by acting in comedy sketches. Jim moved to New York City after graduation, but it took years for him to breakthrough. He eventually relocated to Los Angeles, where he landed a regular gig at The Horn, a Santa Monica tavern where he sang and was discovered by Andy Griffith while also playing in cabaret theatre.</p><h2><span id=Gomer_Pyle_Andy_Griffith_Show_Awards>Gomer Pyle, Andy Griffith Show, Awards</span></h2><p>Andy Griffith brought Jim to his show and cast him as Gomer Pyle in one episode; this became Jim’s most important part in his career.

His role was turned into the spin-off show “Gomer Pyle: USMC,” which aired for five years and 150 episodes, making Jim a national celebrity. Jim was made an honorary Sergeant during the ball celebrating the 238th Marine Corps birthday on November 15th, 2013, bestowed by Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. James F. Amos, after his character joined the US Marine Corps.</p><p>Furthermore, upon Jim’s death, the Marine Corps issued the following statement about Nabors: “Semper Fi, Gomer Pyle. Rest in peace, Jim Nabors, one of the few Honorary Marines ever.” Stan was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1991 for his contributions to the entertainment industry.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Ojani Noa- Wiki, Net Worth, Wife, Height</a></h3>Ojani Noa, a Cuban native, has mainly appeared in English-language movies.
