Plus, he also starts having nightmares, stressing him out.</p><p>In the show's timeline, on November 5, 2019, Jonas’ confusion and curiosity led him to his father’s workroom, where he hung himself in a belief to find some clue.</p><p>He initially finds nothing but some non-understandable paintings. He then notices something at the top of the room, where he finds a map of the Winden&nbsp;caves.
