<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Is Jermain Defoe Christian? Football Player Ethnicity, Religion &amp;amp; Origin</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Jermain Defoe</strong>, the soccer coach, is a devout Christian. He was raised in a Catholic environment and attended a Christian school. As Defoe confesses, religion is a significant aspect of his existence. He even has a Psalm 91 tattoo that proclaims his beliefs. Jermain Colin Defoe OBE was born on October 7, 1982, in London, England, and is a successful English soccer coach and former professional player.</p><p>He began his career with Charlton Athletic and quickly ascended through the ranks, demonstrating his ability as a striker. His major periods with West Ham United, Tottenham Hotspur, and Portsmouth defined his career and demonstrated his goal-scoring prowess. Defoe created Premier League history by scoring 100 goals and became the league’s top-scoring replacement.&nbsp;His international involvement was also significant, with 57 appearances for England and 20 goals, including a memorable appearance at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.&nbsp;As Tottenham Hotspur’s under-18s coach, he now coaches prospective players.</p><h2>Jermain Defoe Religion: Is He a Christian? Ethnicity and Place of Origin</h2><p><strong>Jermain Defoe</strong> was born in East London’s Beckton to a Dominican father and a Saint Lucian mother. Defoe is a devoted Christian whose religion is important in his life. He was raised in a Catholic environment and went to a Christian school, where he learned to cherish his faith. When asked about the 10 things he can’t live without in an interview with Toronto Life, he mentioned the Bible. “I always have one with me,” he said. I grew up in a Catholic household, and my family instilled in me the importance of religion.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jermain-Defoe-1.jpg alt="Jermain Defoe" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He takes refuge in his religion, particularly during difficult times, thinking that disappointments may eventually turn out to be blessings in disguise.&nbsp;His Psalm 91 tattoo, a tangible monument to his views, is one embodiment of his faith. Defoe’s faith in God is unshakeable, and he considers his soccer abilities to be a supernatural gift.&nbsp;He stresses the significance of family and religion, recognizing that these values grow more important with age.</p><p>Despite his strong religious convictions, Defoe was cited in divorce proceedings by Tony Calvert, Rachel Calvert’s jilted husband, who accused Defoe of breaking up his marriage.&nbsp;This episode raised concerns about Defoe’s behavior being inconsistent with his Christian principles. Defoe, on the other hand, has not publicly remarked on the subject of his religion.</p><h2>Defoe Responds to Dale Houghton’s Bradley Lowery Mockery</h2><p><strong>Dale Houghton</strong>, a Sheffield Wednesday fan, faces prison after pleading guilty to ridiculing the death of child mascot <strong>Bradley Lowery</strong>.&nbsp;Houghton, 31, was charged with a public order violation after posting a picture on social media showing himself and another guy smiling at Hillsborough Stadium while carrying a photo of Bradley. In 2017, he died of neuroblastoma at the age of six.</p><p>Houghton’s acts were criticized by Defoe, who had a close acquaintance with Bradley, who said, “I’m appalled and saddened by the actions of the individual in question.”&nbsp;Defoe asked the public to support Bradley’s parents, Gemma and Carl, and complimented the Bradley Lowery Foundation’s efforts.&nbsp;Sheffield Wednesday supporters launched a fundraising campaign, garnering nearly £22,500 for the charity.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jermain-Defoe-2.jpg alt="Jermain Defoe" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Houghton is scheduled to be sentenced on November 17 and faces a possible prison sentence. Bradley’s mother, Gemma Lowery, called the act “unforgivable” and expressed appreciation for the outpouring of public support.&nbsp;The cash earned will go toward the foundation’s Super Brads Pad project, which is a vacation house for families of terminally ill children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigrGWamr%2BurcinZJ2dlqSybq%2FHq6CsrJmWu26yzqirm5mcoXqxuMCynKtllam1r7XCoquyZaKauaqzyKilZqeinrSquo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-american-model-nikki-mudarris-net-worth-details-her-properties-income.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Is The American Model Nikki Mudarris' Net Worth?
